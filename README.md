# Hugo O. Barrera

Most of my work is gradually moving away from this closed, proprietary
platform:

- [my dotfiles](https://git.sr.ht/~whynothugo/dotfiles)
- [repositories on sourcehut](https://git.sr.ht/~whynothugo)
- [repositories on gitlab](https://gitlab.com/WhyNotHugo)

Only existing projects that are well established are remaining here, for now.
